# The Shoppies

## Description

The Shoppies is a React Native twist on the Shopify's [Fall 2021 Intern UX & Web Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SdR9rQpocsH5rPTOcxr9noqHRld5NJlylKO9Hf94U8U). The general idea behind the app follows being able to add and remove movies that are searched from the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to a nominations list. The app's appearance was made to mimick Shopify's [Shop app](https://shop.app/). In the process of doing so, the app was designed under the Shopify's [Polaris Design Guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/). As of right now the app only supports Android devices.
